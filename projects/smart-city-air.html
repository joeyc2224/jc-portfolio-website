                <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
                <p>
                    This study, conducted in collaboration with Smart-H, investigated the potential of smart city and
                    smart vehicle technologies to mitigate urban air pollution and its associated public health impacts,
                    with Exeter serving as a case study.
                    <br><br>
                    As urbanisation accelerates globally, with 55% of the world’s population now residing in cities, a
                    figure projected to rise to 68% by 2050, the health risks linked to urban air pollution have become
                    increasingly urgent. Vehicle emissions, especially from diesel engines, are major contributors to
                    this pollution, leading to serious health issues including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.
                    Smart-H are developing pioneering technologies, such as HydroDrive and QuantumDrive, aimed at
                    reducing these emissions and are central to this study. HydroDrive improves fuel combustion by
                    injecting hydrogen into diesel engines, thereby reducing harmful pollutants. QuantumDrive will
                    expand on this capability, by enabling real-time adjustments to engine performance based on a
                    vehicle’s proximity to sensitive areas, such as schools and hospitals. The integration of these
                    technologies within a broader smart city framework holds the potential to significantly reduce urban
                    air pollution and its associated health risks.
                    <br><br>
                    The research sought to define what constituted a smart city, focusing on how these technologies
                    could address public health challenges. Previous smart city frameworks have often overlooked the
                    profound impact that technology can have on public health, making this study particularly relevant.
                    Through the lens of Exeter, the project examines how Smart-H’s innovations can dynamically reduce
                    harmful emissions, enhance air quality, and improve public health outcomes. It also identifies which
                    types of vehicles and roads would derive the greatest benefit, providing data-driven insights to
                    support these conclusions.
                    <br><br>
                    The findings demonstrated that deploying HydroDrive technology resulted in significant reductions in
                    key pollutants when applied to diesel vehicles on major roads in and out of the city, with the
                    greatest impact observed in heavy-duty vehicles. Specifically, NO2 concentrations decreased by 5.53%
                    in roadside areas, while PM2.5 levels were reduced by 2.55%. In vulnerable locations such as care
                    homes, NO2 levels dropped by 2.31%, and PM2.5 concentrations fell by 1.62%. These reductions are
                    particularly important given the chronic exposure of urban populations to these pollutants and the
                    associated health risks.
                    <br><br>
                    In terms of public health impact, the implementation of HydroDrive technology is estimated to reduce
                    mortality attributable to NO2 and PM2.5 pollution by 0.10 to 0.15%, respectively, across the entire
                    Exeter area. This reduction translates to approximately three fewer air pollution-related deaths
                    annually in Exeter, and when extrapolated to a national level, could potentially lead to 1,200 fewer
                    deaths across the UK. While modest, this represents a meaningful improvement in public health
                    outcomes.
                    <br><br>
                    This research highlights that even small reductions in pollutant levels can yield significant health
                    benefits, highlighting the critical importance of integrating smart vehicle technologies within a
                    smart city framework. The value of these technologies extends beyond environmental and economic
                    improvements; they represent a tangible enhancement in the quality and length of human life, a
                    metric that holds immeasurable worth.

                <h3>Models Based on Real-World Data</h3>
                <p>Using ADMS Urban, a professional-grade air pollution modelling software, I conducted simulations of
                    traffic-related air pollution in Exeter. These simulations utilised real-world meteorological data,
                    traffic patterns, and emission factor datasets gathered from official sources, including the Met
                    Office and Exeter City Council.</p>

                <h3>Exceptional Accuracy in Air Quality Modelling</h3>
                <p>Comparisons between the simulation results and real-world data from Exeter City Council highlight the
                    impressive precision of this model. Modelled nitrogen dioxide concentrations closely mirror actual
                    measurements, with all values falling within a 1% margin of real-world observations—demonstrating
                    the model's reliability in capturing air quality dynamics.</p>

                <h3>Measurable Impact on Public Health</h3>
                <p>Implementing Smart-H’s HydroDrive across all diesel vehicles demonstrates a tangible reduction in
                    deaths attributable to air pollution. The data shows a clear decline in mortality rates linked to
                    NO₂ and PM₂.₅ exposure, highlighting the public health benefits of smart city technology.</p>
